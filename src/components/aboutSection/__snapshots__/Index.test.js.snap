        <p>
          I am a junior full stack developer with a background in the food industry and automotive service. I started my professional career with an apprenticeship as a brewer and maltster. After finishing the apprenticeship as the best apprentice in Lower Bavaria, I started my education at the Technical University of Berlin to obtain a diploma as a master brewer, which I successfully completed in 2008
          <br />
          <br />
          After that I worked for the ARWE Group, until then europe's largest company in automotive service, as team leader and later on as quality manager.
          <br />
          When the group went bankrupt during the Corona crisis, I was now able to consistently realise my long-held wish for a reorientation. To realise my long-cherished wish I had already gained my first experience of coding at CodeCademy.com and was sure that coding would be my future. 
          <br />
          When I was offered the chance to attend a bootcamp at Spiced Academy to become a full stack web developer, I took it.
          <br />
          <br />
          In this intensive 12 week course I dived into the depths of JavaScript. At Spiced Academy I built my first full stack web applications using third party APIs, frontend frameworks like React.js and Vue.js and backend like Express. After graduating from the Spiced Academy, I completed the web development career path at CodeCademy. 
          <br />
          Since I personally want to develop myself further and development for mobile devices is becoming more and more important, I started developing my first apps with react-native and Google Firebase. So feel free to have a look at some of my code on
